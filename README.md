# MultiPeerPuppies
Test Program for MultiPeer Connectivity

This app tests multipeer connectivity. It demonstrates making manual connections and sending data back and forth.

Limitations include:

* It does not reliably connect to peers running iOS versions older than 10.0

* It does not automattically reconnect when connections are lost.

Acknowlegements:

* Large parts of this app were copied from the Hacking with Swift tutorial at:

  https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-create-a-peer-to-peer-network-using-the-multipeer-connectivity-framework

* The multipeer interface code was extracted from the view controller into a separate class a la Apple's MultiPeerGroupChat sample:

* Future enhancements will include automatic connect and reconnect. The WWDC 2014 session 709 "Cross Platform Nearby Networking" gave some great tips.
